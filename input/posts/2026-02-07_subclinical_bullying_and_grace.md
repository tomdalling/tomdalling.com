In medicine there is the concept of a disease being "subclinical", and I think
the concept can apply to bullying in the workplace.

Every workplace has a threshold for bad behaviour, and subclinical bullying is
bad behaviour which doesn't cross the threshold. Much like how a doctor often
won't treat a subclinical disease, your manager often won't address subclinical
bullying. There are lots of reasons why this might be the case, for better or
for worse. One of those reasons might be that your manager is showing grace,
which can feel unfair, but is also important for a healthy team dynamic.

## Doctors

A subclinical disease --- in non-scientific, normal person terms --- is a
disease where you might have some early or mild symptoms, and maybe even some
blood work or other test results, that would indicate you could have a certain
disease, but the evidence isn't conclusive enough to warrant the usual treatment
for that disease. The doctor may agree that something is not quite right but
will refuse to offer treatment.

Why would a doctor refuse to offer treatment while also agreeing something could
be wrong? There are a bunch of good (and not so good) reasons.

- The doctor could suspect that the symptoms are imagined and not real. Everyone
  is at least a little bit of a hypochondriac. That's just how humans are. This
  is more likely if the symptoms are not particularly strong (which they aren't,
  because it's subclinical).

- While you have first-hand experience of what's happening in your own body over
  a long period of time, the doctor doesn't have that wealth of information, and
  needs to rely on the limited information they hear from you and what the test
  results say. The doctor is evaluating the situation based on a different set
  of information to you.

- Symptoms and test results have natural fluctuations that could look like a
  disease when in fact there isn't one. If a single blood test result comes back
  slightly outside of the normal range, that's not enough evidence to
  conclusively prove something is wrong. It might be normal for that person, or
  it could be an outlier and not indicative of what's really happening. There is
  a chance that everything will be fine and correct itself without intervention.

- Symptoms and test results could indicate a range of possible diseases, not
  just a single disease, and those possibilities would need to be eliminated
  before deciding on treatment.

- The treatment itself usually has costs, risks, and side effects, that could
  outweigh any potential benefits. The more mild the symptoms are, the less
  value you would receive from treatment, making the potential downsides of
  treatment an important consideration.

- The doctor could be acting on their own biases. Everyone is at least a little
  bit biased. That's just how humans are. One of the unfortunate things about
  humans is that we have self-protective mechanisms in our mind that blind us to
  our own biases, and it take dedicated effort to discover and correct for them.
  That's quite a difficult thing to do, and so it's incredibly easy to act on
  gut feelings and instincts without examining them.

And the list goes on.


## Managers

There is a similar pattern in the workplace, where instead of diseases we're
talking about bullying, harassment, discrimination, or other inappropriate
behaviours (which I'll just refer to as "bullying" here, for the sake of
brevity) and instead of doctors we're talking about managers. There are
situations where your manager might agree that something is not quite right, but
for better or worse, will refuse to act on it.

Why would a manager refuse to address bullying while also agreeing that it could
be happening? The reasons are similar.

- The manager could suspect that there isn't _really_ any bullying happening.
  It's not uncommon for someone to feel like they've been wronged, but on closer
  inspection they've actually misunderstood or misinterpreted what happened.
  That's just how humans are. This is more likely to happen if the alleged
  bullying is subtle or more minor in nature (which it is, because it's
  subclinical).

- While you have first-hand experience of what's been happening to you, your
  manager unfortunately doesn't, and needs to rely on the limited information
  received from not just you but everyone involved. Your manager is evaluating
  the situation based on a different set of information to you.

- Conflict is a natural occurrence, and is not always a bad thing. Sometimes it
  can be difficult to differentiate between natural, constructive conflict that
  will play out and resolve itself, and something more sinister that should be
  stopped. One single complaint isn't enough to conclusively prove it either
  way unless it's particularly egregious (which it isn't, because it's
  subclinical).

- A complaint about subtle bullying could indicate a range of possible problems,
  not just bullying, and those possibilities should be eliminated before taking
  action. Jumping straight to a conclusion of bullying and then later
  discovering that wasn't correct is pretty terrible for everyone involved.

- Taking action against bullying _will_ have costs, risks, and side effects, for
  both you and your manager. So depending on how minor or subtle the bullying is,
  addressing it could leave you in a worse situation overall, and therefore
  might not be worth it. This hurts my soul a little bit to type out, but I
  don't think it's incorrect.

- Your manager could be refusing to act due to their own biases. There is no
  shortage of stories about situations like this, and it disproportionately
  affects underrepresented groups.

- And last but not least, your manager might be showing _grace_. This one only
  applies to managers, not doctors. It's a nuanced and delicate topic that I
  want to explore in a bit more detail below.


## Grace

Genuinely good and decent human beings absolutely _will fuck up_ from time to
time. Nobody is perfect, people have bad days, et cetera.

Showing grace, in this context, is the act of _allowing_ someone to fuck up ---
maybe letting them get away with doing a little bit of bullying --- in
acknowledgement of the fact that we are all imperfect humans and shouldn't be
punished for every little mistake we make.

Should they be allowed to get away with serious bullying? No. No grace for big
fuck ups. Should they be allowed to get away with subtle bullying forever? No.
No grace for a pattern of repeated fuck ups. But if it's not a pattern of
behaviour, and it really is quite minor in terms of seriousness, should they be
afforded grace? Yes, in my opinion.

From the outside, as the person on the receiving end of the subtle bullying,
this can feel unfair. And it is. It's basically saying: yes, what happened to
you was probably wrong, but we're not going to do anything about it. The only
consolation I can give --- the only thing that approaches fairness --- is that
you should be eligible for grace too. Today you're taking one for the team, but
tomorrow, when you fuck up, you'll be glad that someone else is taking one for
the team.

Despite the unfairness, grace is actually an important aspect of creating a
healthy work environment. When people are punished for every tiny mistake, they
start pretending to be perfect, and this creates a slew of problems with the
team dynamic. It might be counter-intuitive, but allowing some bad behaviour, in
a controlled fashion, prevents worse behaviour from becoming entrenched in the
team.

Receiving grace should not mean that someone can ignore what what they did, and
move on without acknowledging it --- quite the opposite. Being given grace is an
opportunity to acknowledge the mistake, talk about it, and learn from it,
without fear of punishment. If someone can't acknowledge what happened they're
unlikely to receive grace in the future.
