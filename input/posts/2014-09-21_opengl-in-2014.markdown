Valve is investing in OpenGL to hedge themselves against Microsoft. Some
well-known developers have written about the deficiencies in the API. A few
competing, proprietary APIs have popped up. In an effort to remain competitive,
Khronos announces glnext: a ground-up rethinking of the OpenGL and OpenGL ES
APIs. This post will look at developments in the OpenGL ecosystem over the last
couple of years.

Valve
-----

In July of 2012, Valve announced that they were developing a Linux version of
Steam. In late 2013, Valve further announced their new Linux-based operating
system [SteamOS][].

On Linux, OpenGL is the only API available for hardware accellerated 3D.
Therefore, an investment in Linux necessarily means an investment in OpenGL.
While porting Left 4 Dead 2 to Linux, Valve stated: ["We've been working with
Nvidia, AMD, and Intel to improve graphic driver performance on
Linux"][left4dead2_port].

On top of that, Valve have developed and open-sourced a couple of OpenGL tools.
[ToGL][] is a Direct3D to OpenGL translation layer, including a HLSL to GLSL
converter. [Vogl][] provides some sorely-needed debugging facilities.  These
two projects were dumped onto github in a somewhat hasty manner.  Nevertheless,
these are welcome additions, considering the historical lack of tooling in the
OpenGL ecosystem.

On top of _that_, Valve are also [funding some development][mesa_funding] of
Mesa, an open-source implementation of OpenGL.

This is all great news for OpenGL in general. Everyone benefits from such a
large and influential company pushing for better performance, tooling, and
stability. As long a Valve's long-term strategy continues to involves Linux,
they will be a boon to OpenGL.

Criticism
---------

It wasn't all roses from Valve, though. [Rich Geldreich][], who developed
Vogl as a Valve employee, started a storm with his blog post: [Things that
drive me nuts about OpenGL][rich_first_post]. His post is a laundry list
of OpenGL criticisms, compared to other modern graphics APIs. It set off
a [cascade of reactions][]. The pains that Rich identified resonated with a lot
of OpenGL developers, although some dismissed them with a [big middle
finger][].

In June of 2014, [Rich wrote][rich_leave]:

> BTW - I'm no longer at Valve or working on vogl. And no, I'm not being paid
> by, nor do I know anyone still at Apple, lol. 

To me, Vogl represented real progress in an ecosystem that was maybe a bit
stagnant, so it's a little disheartening to see Rich leaving so soon.

Mantle, Metal, and DirectX 12
-----------------------------

In September of 2013, AMD announced a new, low-level graphics API called
[Mantle][], designed to be an alternative to OpenGL and Direct3D. The idea with
Mantle was to allow direct access to AMD hardware with an absolute minimum of
driver overhead, something that OpenGL and DirectX didn't really offer at the
time. AMD boasted that Mantle offered large performance gains compared to "other
APIs." A few large names, such as Crytek and DICE, jumped on board, and
implemented Mantle in their game engines. AMD also claimed that Mantle would
eventually be an open standard, but currently, a year after its announcement,
we are still yet to see any progress towards this.

A few months later, Microsoft announces DirectX 12, which sounds a lot like
Mantle. The main difference from DX11 is the significantly reduced driver
overhead, and more direct access to hardware.

Then, in July of 2014, Apple follows suit and releases its own low-level
graphics API called [Metal][].  Prior to Metal, OpenGL ES was the only option
for iOS devices. In fact, Apple's use of OpenGL ES in their iPhones was one of
the major factors contributing to the OpenGL renaissance that we see today. And
now, having been such an ally, Apple turns around and creates a competitor.
Some speculate that Apple dislikes the cross-platform nature of OpenGL, and
would prefer to lock developers into the iOS ecosystem.  Others say that Metal
is just a better API, and OpenGL was ripe for replacement.

With three cutting-edge competitors announced within a year of eachother, while
OpenGL still carries 20 years of baggage along with it, it's not unreasonable
to beleive that OpenGL may be fighting for its survival over the next few
years.

Joshua Barczak explains this new taste for low-level graphics APIs in his
excellent blog post: [The Race to the Metal][].

AZDO
----

At GDC 2014, back in March, developers from AMD, Nvidia, and Intel came
together to give a presentation called [Approaching Zero Driver Overhead][]
(AZDO).  The premise of the presentation is that OpenGL 4.4 does actually
provide low-level functionality, sort of like Mantle, if you know where to find
it. This presentation is a fantastic overview of the cutting-edge features of
OpenGL.

glnext
------

Last month, in a [presentation at SIGGRAPH 2014][siggraph_pres],
Khronos announced the "Next Generation OpenGL Initiative" (which I'm going to
refer to as "glnext" here).

</figure>

Here are a few excerpts from the presentation, relating to glnext:

 - After twenty two years -- need ground up design of API for high-efficiency
   access to graphics and compute on modern GPUs.
 - Incremental change is not enough. GL has a good track record of adaptive
   evolution... but structural problems can’t be fixed by accretion.
 - Who's on board: Valve, Apple, AMD, Intel, Nvidia, and others.
 - Fast-paced work on detailed proposals and designs are already underway
 - NOT your father’s multi-year design-by-committee process
 - Goals:
    - Clean, modern architecture
    - Greatly reduced CPU overhead
    - Multi-thread / multicore-friendly
    - Improved reliability and consistency between implementations
    - Unify OpenGL and OpenGL ES

In the presentation, Khronos directly mentions [Rich Gelrich's
criticisms][rich_first_post] under the heading "OpenGL needs to change", and I
think that this is a great indication that we will see some real improvements
baked into glnext. John McDonald from Valve states that "glnext is shaping up
to be _amazing_."

Richard Huddy [says][huddy] that AMD is giving Khronos full access to Mantle,
and will impose no restrictions or licensing fees if glnext takes ideas from
the architecture of Mantle.

OpenGL 4.5 And The Current Ecosystem
------------------------------------

But wait, there's more! While we wait for glnext, OpenGL development rolls on.
In the same SIGGRAPH 2014 presentation, Khronos announced OpenGL 4.5, and gave
an overview of the whole OpenGL ecosystem.

Among other things, 4.5 finally, **finally**, brings Direct State Access (DSA)
into core. It's my personal opinion that a lot of the perceived cruft in OpenGL
stems from being forced to constantly manipulate the state machine, which is
basically a huge collection of mutable global variables, and DSA alleviates a
lot of this pain. In addition to the developer-frendliness that DSA brings,
it also enables a set of possible performance improvements.

In tooling news, Vogl development continues, and it now runs on Windows. AMD,
Nvidia, and Intel are all improving performance profiling through their own
proprietary tools. The GLSL reference validator is getting better, helping to
fix headaches around cross-platform shader compilation.

Conformance testing is also being ramped up. One of OpenGL's uglier problems
is driver conformance, but it appears that this situation is improving.

Conclusion
----------

The AZDO presentation showed that OpenGL is still competitive when compared to
Mantle, Metal, and DirectX 12. Also, glnext is poised to clean up a lot of the
crusty parts, and unify OpenGL and OpenGL ES into a single, modern,
ultra-cross-platform API.

I think this slide from the SIGGRAPH presentation sums up why OpenGL is, and
will remain to be, relevant:

Mantle only currently works with certain AMD hardware on Windows. Metal only
works on iOS. DirectX 12 will only work on Windows. **OpenGL is the only truly
cross-platform option**.  It's the only option that works on all hardware
across Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS. It's the _only_ option on Linux,
so if Valve's vision for Linux comes to fruition, OpenGL will be more relevant
than ever.

I'm optimistic about the future of OpenGL/glnext. We just have to wait and see
if the vendors play nice together.
