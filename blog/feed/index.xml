      <title>Subclinical Bullying And Grace</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/mentoring/subclinical_bullying_and_grace/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In medicine there is the concept of a disease being “subclinical”, and I think
the concept can apply to bullying in the workplace.</p>

<p>Every workplace has a threshold for bad behaviour, and subclinical bullying is
bad behaviour which doesn’t cross the threshold. Much like how a doctor often
won’t treat a subclinical disease, your manager often won’t address subclinical
bullying. There are lots of reasons why this might be the case, for better or
for worse. One of those reasons might be that your manager is showing grace,
which can feel unfair, but is also important for a healthy team dynamic.</p>

private document written for engineers who report to me and who are running
projects in a technical lead role, which lists out a set of project management
responsibilities and expectations.</p>

      <title>The Difference Between Management And Leadership</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/management/the-difference-between-management-and-leadership/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The tl;dr is that management is a set of powers and accountabilities that the
 role confers upon you, whereas leadership is the ability to motivate followers.
 Anyone can be a leader, and teams run on leadership not management. Management
 is not necessarily bad, but management without leadership is pretty dang
 terrible! Also management is like the nervous system of an octopus.</p>

      <title>Feedback Is Literally A Gift</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/random-stuff/feedback-is-a-gift/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Feedback is a gift.</p>

<p>Some gifts are little treats for you to consume. Think of a box of chocolates.
You enjoy them and then they’re gone, but you remember the thought that was put
into them.</p>

<p>Sometimes gifts are utilitarian, like getting socks for Christmas. They are not
the most exciting thing to receive, but you kind of need them as part of your
normal day-to-day life, and you’ll get use out of them.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this, the third and final part of this series, I’m going to present 10
recommendations for avoiding the pitfalls of using bucketed prioritisation (e.g.
must haves, nice to haves, etc.), covered in the previous two parts.</p>

      <title>High Performance Requires Process</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/high-performance-requires-process/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Processes are a prerequisite for high-performance in software engineering teams
due to their ability to amplify the skill of the team. I believe there exists no
team, given that there is little to no process to begin with, whose performance
could not be improved by adding appropriate process.</p>

      <title>Ditch The Umbrella And Grab Some Sunnies</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/ditch-the-umbrella-and-grab-some-sunnies/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Engineering Managers (EMs) are sometimes said to be “shit umbrellas”. They are
supposed to keep all the distractions away from the team: the short-lived whims
and fancies of various stakeholders, vague plans that are going to change
several times before being solidified — all that stuff. Distractions are
poisonous to good software, so hiding them should help the team deliver more and
better software. A large part of this is true.</p>

<p>However, I would like to argue here that behaving like an umbrella is probably
not a good thing. Umbrellas are shields that block rain. And what are these EMs
blocking? Hopefully distractions, but also <em>information</em> and <em>reality</em>.</p>
