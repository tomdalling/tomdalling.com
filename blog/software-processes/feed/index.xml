      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this, the third and final part of this series, I’m going to present 10
recommendations for avoiding the pitfalls of using bucketed prioritisation (e.g.
must haves, nice to haves, etc.), covered in the previous two parts.</p>

      <title>High Performance Requires Process</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/high-performance-requires-process/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Processes are a prerequisite for high-performance in software engineering teams
due to their ability to amplify the skill of the team. I believe there exists no
team, given that there is little to no process to begin with, whose performance
could not be improved by adding appropriate process.</p>

      <title>Ditch The Umbrella And Grab Some Sunnies</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/ditch-the-umbrella-and-grab-some-sunnies/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Engineering Managers (EMs) are sometimes said to be “shit umbrellas”. They are
supposed to keep all the distractions away from the team: the short-lived whims
and fancies of various stakeholders, vague plans that are going to change
several times before being solidified — all that stuff. Distractions are
poisonous to good software, so hiding them should help the team deliver more and
better software. A large part of this is true.</p>

<p>However, I would like to argue here that behaving like an umbrella is probably
not a good thing. Umbrellas are shields that block rain. And what are these EMs
blocking? Hopefully distractions, but also <em>information</em> and <em>reality</em>.</p>

      <title>Nugs And Negative Failure Demand</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/nugs-and-negative-failure-demand/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this article I’m going to take a look at software quality as a way to
differentiate between junior, mid-level, and senior software engineers, through
the lens of <em>failure demand</em>, purely so that I can introduce a new concept that
I thought up on a walk today, which I’m calling <em>negative failure demand</em>.</p>

bucket leads engineering to make bad decisions.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Categorising requirements into buckets like “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves” is
a common approach to prioritisation in software projects. In my opinion, this is
a bad way to priortise work, for reasons which become clear when you look at the
incentives it produces.</p>

      <title>Agile Is A Glass Cannon</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/agile-is-a-glass-cannon/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent shower thought of mine is that agile software development
might be similar to the strategic concept of a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/glass_cannon"><em>glass
cannon</em></a> in gaming —
specifically, that it’s a high-risk high-reward strategy where the risk can be
mitigated by skill/experience.</p>

      <title>Better User Stories</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/better-user-stories/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>As a member of the software industry, I want user stories to focus
more on the problem definition, so that we can make better choices
around how to implement a solution.</p>

<p>Or should I say:</p>

<p>As a member of the software industry, it’s easy to decide on a
solution or implementation details too quickly, without a good
understanding of the problem we are trying to solve. This leads to
suboptimal software for the end user, technical debt, and rework that
could have been avoided. I propose that we change the user story
format to focus more on the problem definition, and less on a single
solution.</p>

      <title>How To Set Up A Secure Git Server At Home (OSX)</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/how-to-set-up-a-secure-git-server-at-home-osx/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this article I’m going to show you, step by step, how to set up an OSX
machine to provide secure access to git repositories over the internet via ssh.
This was tested on OSX 10.6.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com">github</a> provides git repository hosting with a lovely interface. If github
isn’t feasible, then this article will help you set up something similar,
unfortunately without the nice interface.</p>

<p>I assume that you already have git installed. If not, install the latest
version from <a href="http://git-scm.com">the git website</a>.</p>

<p>We will be walking through the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Give the server a static IP address on the local network</li>
  <li>Set up port forwarding on the router</li>
  <li>Getting dynamic DNS</li>
  <li>Add a user named “git” to the server</li>
  <li>Setting up ssh securely on the client computers</li>
  <li>Setting up ssh securely on the server</li>
  <li>Making a bare git repository</li>
  <li>Using your new git server</li>
</ul>
