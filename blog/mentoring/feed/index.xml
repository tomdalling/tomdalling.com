      <title>Subclinical Bullying And Grace</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/mentoring/subclinical_bullying_and_grace/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In medicine there is the concept of a disease being “subclinical”, and I think
the concept can apply to bullying in the workplace.</p>

<p>Every workplace has a threshold for bad behaviour, and subclinical bullying is
bad behaviour which doesn’t cross the threshold. Much like how a doctor often
won’t treat a subclinical disease, your manager often won’t address subclinical
bullying. There are lots of reasons why this might be the case, for better or
for worse. One of those reasons might be that your manager is showing grace,
which can feel unfair, but is also important for a healthy team dynamic.</p>

      <title>Marketing Yourself As A Junior Engineer</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/mentoring/marketing-yourself-as-a-junior-engineer/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result
of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for
every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know
neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.</p>

  <p>— Sun Tzu, <em>The Art of War</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying for a junior engineering position, or any job, is an exercise
in marketing and sales. You are the product, and the employer is a
potential customer. To market and sell anything effectively, you need
to understand how the customer thinks.</p>

<p>In this article, I want to explore a bit of employer psychology when
it comes to hiring juniors, and give some suggestions that I
believe increase your chance of success.</p>
