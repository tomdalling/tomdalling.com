      <title>An In-depth Look At Manual Memory Management In Objective-C</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/cocoa/an-in-depth-look-at-manual-memory-management-in-objective-c/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It feels like fleets of new developers dash themselves upon the rocky shores of
Objective-C memory management every day on StackOverflow. I can't bear to write
the same answers over and over again, so this article will be my final,
unabridged explanation of: <code>retain</code>, <code>release</code>, <code>autorelease</code>, <code>alloc</code>,
<code>dealloc</code>, <code>copy</code>, and <code>NSAutoreleasePool</code>. There will be some rules to
memorize, but we will also take a journey under the hood for a deeper
understanding.</p>

<p>This article is intended for people who are new to Objective-C, or who never
fully learnt how manual reference counting works. It does assume that you have
some programming experience, possibly in another language. If you are a
beginner programmer and Objective-C is your first language, I will try to keep
the explanations clear, but it may become confusing the more in-depth we get.</p>

<p>We will be covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Quick Mention Of ARC And Garbage Collection</li>
  <li>Coming From C/C++</li>
  <li>Coming From a Garbage Collected Language (Java, Python, C#, etc.)</li>
  <li>What Is Reference Counting?</li>
  <li>How Does Reference Counting Work In Objective-C?</li>
  <li>
<code>NSAutoreleasePool</code> And <code>autorelease</code>
</li>
  <li>Common Mistakes</li>
</ul>

<p>If something is not explained, or not explained very well, post a question in
the comments and I'll expand the article to cover it.</p>

      <title>Gotchas With Grand Central Dispatch (libdispatch) And Blocks</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/cocoa/gotchas-with-grand-central-dispatch-libdispatch-and-blocks/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Dispatch" title="Grand Central Dispatch">GCD</a> is a nice replacement for the old
<code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/nsobject_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSObject/performSelectorInBackground:withObject:">performSelectorInBackground:withObject:</a></code> and
<code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/nsobject_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSObject/performSelectorOnMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:">performSelectorOnMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:</a></code> methods
and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSOperation_class/Reference/Reference.html">NSOperation</a>. It's also a nice supplement to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/nsthread_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSThread</a>.</p>

<p>However, I think it was over-hyped a little bit by Apple when it was first
released. You probably have all these random deadlocks and race conditions and
stuff whenever you use multiple threads, but GCD is <em>soooooo good</em> that you
don't have to worry about that anymore. Just use these magic blocks.</p>

<p>The problem is that concurrent programming is notoriously hard to get right.
Maybe GCD helps to make it easier, but It doesn't solve all of your problems.
In fact, GCD and blocks introduce some problems of their own. This article will
focus on some of those problems.</p>

      <title>How Cocoa Bindings Work (via KVC and KVO)</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/cocoa/how-cocoa-bindings-work-via-kvc-and-kvo/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Cocoa bindings can be a little confusing, especially to newcomers. Once you
have an understanding of the underlying concepts, bindings aren't too hard. In
this article, I'm going to explain the concepts behind bindings from the ground
up; first explaining Key-Value Coding (KVC), then Key-Value Observing (KVO),
and finally explaining how Cocoa bindings are built on top of KVC and KVO.</p>

      <title>Why performSelector: Is More Dangerous Than I Thought</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/cocoa/why-performselector-is-more-dangerous-than-i-thought/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I fixed a rather nasty bug today in <a href="http://github.com/tomdalling/AspectObjectiveC">AspectObjectiveC</a>. One particular unit
test would crash with <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> every time. After learning far more
about registers and ABIs than I ever wanted to know (thanks, <a href="http://www.sealiesoftware.com/blog/archive/2008/10/30/objc_explain_objc_msgSend_stret.html" title="[objc explain]: objc_msgSend_stret">Greg Parker</a>),
it dawned on me that <code>performSelector:</code> <strong>was corrupting memory</strong>. It was
particularly hard to track down because the crash would happen a couple of
lines <em>after</em> the call to <code>performSelector:</code>, when the corrupted memory was
actually accessed.</p>

<p>I've never had a problem with <code>performSelector:</code> before, but this time I was
using it a little differently. The return value of the selector was an
<code>NSRect</code>.</p>

<p>Now for the gory explanation.</p>

      <title>Implementing Your Own Cocoa Bindings</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/cocoa/implementing-your-own-cocoa-bindings/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This post is the result of investigation into a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1169097/can-you-manually-implement-cocoa-bindings" title="Can you manually implement Cocoa bindings?">stackoverflow.com question of
mine</a>.</p>

<p>So, you've created a spiffy <code>NSView</code> of your own, and have decided to make it
compatible with bindings. Great! So you go and read the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/Concepts/HowDoBindingsWork.html" title="How Do Bindings Work?">documentation</a>, and
you look at mmalc's GraphicsBindings examples. You override
<code>bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options:</code> and everything works. But wait! Why isn't
the <code>NSWindowController</code> ever being deallocated anymore?</p>

<p>Now you've got a nasty retain cycle on your hands. You do a little research and
discover that not only do <a href="http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2004/6/12/109600" title="Retain cycle problem with bindings &amp; NSWindowController">other people have the same problem</a>, but even
<a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/18" title="Bindings and File's Owner">Apple's bindings used to have it</a> a few years ago. How did Apple fix the
problem? With the magic, undocumented class <code>NSAutounbinder</code>, which <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nsautounbinder">nobody
seems to know much about</a>.</p>

<p>Other people will tell you that you don't need to override
<code>bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options:</code> and that bindings work automatically. This
is only a half truth. <code>NSObject</code> does provide an implementation of
<code>bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options:</code>, but it only half works. Using the default
<code>NSObject</code> implementation, changes in the model will update the view, but the
reverse is not true. When the bound property of the view changes, nothing
happens to the model.</p>

<p>So, what is a Cocoa developer to do? I'll explain how to implement your own
bindings that work exactly like Apple's, with no retain cycles. <del>I haven't
found this solution anywhere else, so as far as I know, I'm the discoverer. I
feel so special.</del> It has been <a href="http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2008/6/30/211682" title="Why aren't my bindings firing?">mentioned before</a> at least once. The solution
is hard to find, though.</p>
